I want to build a backend service to function as an ecommerce handling cart, checkout and payment.
Payment can be simulated so focus on cart and placing the order and probably like  a sandbox service that places the order across different sourcing websites.
The cart should show all products from different sourcing urls, along with their corresponding prices, along with their stocks all these will be availabile in our DB.
An add to cart api needs to be exposed to add products to cart and be visible in the cart
The user needs to have a selective checkout option to choose whichever products he needs to checkout with and by default all will be checked.
Once the user clicks checkout the payment needs to be simultated by the sanbox as a success. For now leave the sanbox service as a placeholder url to handle the payments
